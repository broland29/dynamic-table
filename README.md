## Dynamic Table
A dynamic table made in excel using Visual Basic for Applications
  - Summer mini-project, made for fun
  - Table serves as a data holder for students and their results achieved during a particular test
  - Modifiable parameters: number of students, number of problems, grading thresholds
  - Two charts and other text showing analytics about each student and about the class in general
  - Made for my mom so she can use it in school (she is a teacher, and she had an out-dated excel file to do this)
